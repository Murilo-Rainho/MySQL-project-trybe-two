### Project of my web development course at trybe (MySQL)

---

# About this project

> This is my second mysql project. In it, I take a step forward. I use JOINS to bring unified results from two or more different tables. For that, I use some types of JOINS (SELF JOIN, INNER JOIN, RIGHT JOIN and LEFT JOIN).
> Furthermore, I use TRIGGERS to make persistent updates, stored functions for queries that can/will be repeated and stored procedures to save some important query that can be used again just by calling it, instead of creating the query again
